# Java Game

A simple Java game built with Libgdx. I used Copilot for some of this, mostly to test ideas and make sure stuff works. I am a beginner to Java.

## Building & Running

```bash
# Run the game
./gradlew lwjgl3:run

# Build a JAR
./gradlew lwjgl3:jar
```

The built JAR will be at `lwjgl3/build/libs/`.

## Project Structure

- `core/`: Shared game logic
- `lwjgl3/`: Desktop application

## Requirements

- Java 11+
- Gradle (included via wrapper)
